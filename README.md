### Additional notes/lessons learned
Credit to [Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p) for his [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
<br/>Was able to leverage the previous lesson (09-NodeJS) to start the file, before reworking it to include the API module.  These [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) were handy in understanding async functions `try`, `await`, and `catch`.  To create the badge, I used shields.io parameters `:user` and `:repo` for the `last-commit` activity.
